Light Launcher is a fork of mLauncher.
It removes bookmarks (which are barely useful and in fact get in the way of the user) and fix a bug with big icons.

It is very lightweight on CPU and memory, in fact even more so than Google's own launcher and other alternatives.
(Probably the only lighter launcher is Null Launcher, which does nothing)

Most launchers clog up devices with constantly updating widgets and fancy graphics.
Use it if your device struggles speed-wise.
